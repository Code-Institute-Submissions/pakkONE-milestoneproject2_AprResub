            Welcome to the game re(flex)!
            Have you ever thought about the fact that it is harder to let go of things than grabbing onto them?
            In this game, you will be challenged to let go of the key you've pressed down once the counter comes to the
            goal.
            Press and hold down any key to begin... Remember to let go in the right time.
        </div>
        <div id="goal">
            the goal will be displayed here in seconds with three decimals
        </div>
        <div id="counter">
            the counter will go from 0,000 seconds up to 15,000 seconds before it automatically stops unless the user
            has released the key earlier
        </div>
